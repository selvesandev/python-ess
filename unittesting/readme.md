# Unit Testing.
As you begin to expand to large multi-file project it becomes important to have
tests in place.   
This way as you make changes or update your code, you can run your test files to 
make sure previous code still runs as expected.


### Testing Tools
* **pylint** This is a lib that looks at your code and report
back possible if there is errors or styling issues. By styling means a style convention
rules known as as `PEP8`
```
pip3 install pylint
```


* **unittest** This built-in library will allow to test your own programs and check
you are getting desired output.
